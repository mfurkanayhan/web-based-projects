## **This application is one of the web based application.**

**I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery technologies in this application..**
**Note: Try to do it yourself first.**

1. Responsive Layout: According to this screenshot, I developed the codes of the application using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap. The design is suitable for the Chrome web browser and iPhone 12.

2. I created Filters with Toggle Buttons for “Last Trades” section, using Native JavaScript.

3. I edited Placeholder using jquery. The Placeholder, which remains in normal size when there is no value, shrinks when the value is entered and continues to appear above the value.

4. I'm include to live BTC/USD value from Live-coin-watch API.
